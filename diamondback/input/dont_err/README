This directory should contain files to be run by the `input_file_test_suite` in test.ml.

Tests should come in groups of related files:
- someTest.diamond: the input program to be run
- someTest.valgrind: if present, run the program using valgrind

This will test that the program is *supposed* to fail to compile or run, but currently does not.
(Ideally, when your compiler works perfectly, this directory should be empty.  For now, it's better
to document which test cases aren't working as expected.)
